# Context

This is a personal website for Thijmen Pelgr√∂m to display his work as an artist. In the future, a similar site will be launched that displays his work as a craftsman for his own company "De Haakse Hoek".

# Technologies

## Frontend

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Backend

- **Excel**: Excel is used to store information about projects, used instead of a database so that Thijmen can easily manage content himself (a CMS will probably be used in the future)
- **Firebase hosting**: Firebase hosting is used to deliver the frontend application to end users
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) storage**: GCP Storage is used to host image assets
- **Firebase Functions**: Firebase functions is used to serve a public API that fetches and returns the projects using the Excel API
